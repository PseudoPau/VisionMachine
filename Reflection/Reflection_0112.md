3 sites:
**Or we should call them territories**

- Legal. *The physical body. The initial/primary territory we own as we were born.*
	- Chronological documents(Aging; Growing; Dying).
	- Typing by typewriter. Painting by hand. Bricklaying construction. Step by step.
	- No retreat.
- Virtual. *The territory we occupied, the fragments inside the server/stack* 
	- Storytelling. Non-linearâ€¦
	- Edited. Selected. Carved. A perception of perception.
	- Photoshop. Movie. Remix. Back and force.
- Real.  *The territory we stand on.*
	- Things put on the table.
	- The leftover.
