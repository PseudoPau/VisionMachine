## New Diagrams/Ideas
story boarding+narratives
- **Stage setting**-keep working, add dimensions, set up in Unreal Engine

Exhibition Display
- I was imagining something that can interact with the **lookers**, as everything is already an image, and images are looking at you when you are aimlessly looking around.
- I want to play with techniques for **screening** and playing, such as TV, the projection by a direct light, and the screening projector. I want people to be conscious of **their existence**.
- I want to play with focus and attention. What is **moving**? The screen or the content within the screen? I want people to realize the **space and time** *around them* is different with that within a *story* .
